Awesome application!

Hello, I am a recent graduate with a degree in software development. My main language is Java with minor emphasis on JavaScript, PHP, HTML and XML. I am half way through my BS, yet I didn't re-enroll once they told me that the JEE was no longer available due to not having a teacher for the classes. They told me I have to switch to .Net, and I told them No I don't. So I bought Pro Spring 3, and a couple other usefull books and have been studying on my own. I am now looking to start a career in the IT field, and thought that maybe I should come here and look for places I can put my skills to the test. Wish me luck.... No I didn't say put my luck to the test... Wish me skills!
